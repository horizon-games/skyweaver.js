Skyweaver API web-app example
=============================

Welcome to the `skyweaver.js` API example for Web browsers.


## Getting Started

Please first make sure you have a Skyweaver Developer API Key for your project.

You can request an API key at https://request-api-key.skyweaver.net

**Best place to start:** [read the example source here](src/index.ts) :)

## Docs / usage

The skyweaver.js SDK provides type-safe access to the Skyweaver API. The best
reference is to read the [`Client API interface`](/src/skyweaver-api.gen.ts) to
learn the available methods.

Once you have an API key, next steps:

1. cd skyweaver.js/examples/web-app
2. yarn install
3. update the [example source](src/index.ts) to set `apiAccessToken` with your api key
4. yarn dev
5. have fun :D
