Skyweaver API web-app example
=============================

Welcome to the `skyweaver.js` API example for Web browsers.


## Getting Started

Please first make sure you have a Skyweaver Developer API Key for your project.

You can request an API key at https://developers.skyweaver.net

**Best place to start:** [read the example source here](src/index.ts) :)

## Docs / usage

The skyweaver.js SDK provides type-safe access to the Skyweaver API. The best
reference is to read the `Client API interface`[/src/skyweaver-api.gen.ts] to
learn the available methods.

Once you have an API key, next steps:

1. cd skyweaver.js/
2. yarn install
3. yarn build

Now you will have built a local copy of skyweaver.js. Next you can run the examples:

1. cd skyweaver.js/examples/web-app
2. yarn install
3. yarn dev

Next, update the [example source](src/index.ts) to use your api key and have fun.
